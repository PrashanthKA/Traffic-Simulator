# Traffic-Simulator
Autonomous Intersection Manager ( Controls Vehicle Traffic, without Signal or Stop signs )<br />
Objective: <br />
Vehicles should be able to cross intersections without crashes. <br />
We need an efficient Concurrent Traffic management system, so that at a given instance maximum number of vehicles can pass through without being stopped or halted.<br /><br />
Solution:<br />
The Vehicles approaching an intersection would request permission from Intersection Manager.<br />
Reservations are made through Intersection Manager in pre-determined blocks along with TIMESTAMP.<br /><br />
Requirements: Java SDK, Apache Maven
